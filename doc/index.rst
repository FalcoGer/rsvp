RSVP
====
*RSVP* is a `kOS <https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/>`__ library that finds orbital `launch windows <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_window>`__ in the game `Kerbal Space Program <https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/>`__.
The acronym stands for "Rendezvous s’il vous plaît", a playful pun on the regular meaning of the phrase.

This library enables players to make automated low delta-v transfers between two planets or vessels in-game, either directly from their own kOS scripts or from the kOS console. It provides a scriptable alternative to existing tools, such as the excellent web based `Launch Window Planner  <https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/>`__ or the snazzy `MechJeb Maneuver Planner <https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2/wiki/Maneuver-Planner>`__.

Features
--------
* Integrates with your kOS scripts.
* Creates departure and arrival maneuver nodes.
* Supports rendezvous between vessels, planets, moons, asteroids and comets.
* Adapts to planetary packs such as `Galileo's Planet Pack <https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/152136-ksp-181-galileos-planet-pack-v164-01-july-2020/>`__, `Outer Planets Mods <https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/184789-131-18x-outer-planets-mod-v226-4th-feb-2020/>`__ and `JNSQ <https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/184880-181-jnsq-090-03-feb-2020/>`__.
